# Django-SlossCruisers
Django Auction Project - CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

---

SLOSS CRUISERS is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site for Land Cruisers allowing users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.” This site was inspired by my favorite automobile auction website: https://BringATrailer.com 

This site was created using Python, Django framework, SQLite, and Bootstrap 4.4.1 for CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
